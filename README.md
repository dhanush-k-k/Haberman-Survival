# Project Title : "Haberman's Survival Data"

## Purpose and Brief Outcome
The dataset contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer. VArious classification methods were applied and their accuracy was tested for predicting the survival status based on 4 attributes of patients.

## Dependencies
* The project is developed using Jupyter Notebook with Python as the programming language.

## Prerequisites
* Project requires Python 3.11.0 to run.
* Please click on <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Haberman%27s+Survival" target="_blank">Habberman Data</a> which contains the data set

## Installation steps for Jupyter
* Please click on <a href="https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html" target="_blank">Jupyter NoteBook</a> which contains instructions to install using IPython Kernal. 

* Optional : Please click on <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html" target="_blank">Anaconda</a> which contanins instructions to install Anaconda. 

## Methodology and Conclusion
1. Among the various classification methods employes for the prediction, KNN and Decision tree have consistently showed better performance scores compared to other when the program was run multiple times.<br><br>

2. The classification gave highest performance values of 94.2 through KNN method for test data. However the lowest value was in the range of 80 for Discriminant analysis.<br><br>

3. Although, there is not best method, I felt we need to carry out multiple iterations using bigger data to come to a descion on which method to use. Currently, KNN, Navive Bayes are preffered.
